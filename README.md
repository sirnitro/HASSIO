# Welcome to Wilson's Corner my implementation of Home Assistant.

## History:

I begin playing with home automation all the way back with X10. X10 was very unreliable, so I gave up on it for awhile, then the wink hub came out. I purchased one and started off buying bulbs. My wink hub had poor support for some items I was trying to use, and let's face it for a tinker/hacker like me, it had a LOT to be desired.

Welcome Home Assistant.

I am running HASS.IO on a Raspberry Pi 3+. I will be adding to this as I am able to.
